# Bulk_Email_Sender-made-using-PHP

It's pretty easy to use, all you need to do is visit the script from the web and provide the smtp host and other details which is really easy to fill out. You can also send emails to people separated by commas, which will send the bulk email to anyone you want. This script uses PHPMailer as it's pretty decent and easy to use.

Note: It does not have a front-end design yet.
